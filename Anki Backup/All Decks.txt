What's the three types of version control?	Local, Centralized, Distributed
What is Local version control system?	Database is on your local computer<br>
What is centralized version control system?<br>	A single server that contains all the versioned files
What is the downside of centralized version control system	If server goes down, you fuck up.<br>You may lose the entire history of the project.
What is the major issue of local version control system?	People need to collaborate with developers on other systems.
Compare to Local Version Control System, what is the advantage of using centralized?	More collaborate
What is a Distributed Version Control System?	It is a form of version control which the complete codespace, including its full history, is mirrored on every developer's computer.
What is the advantage of Distributed Version Control System?	If any server crashes, they can get back up from any of the client's repositories. (Github)
In pipes and filters, what is the meaning of the following?<br>1, Program_1 | Program_2<br>2, Program_1 &gt; file.txt<br>3, Program_1 &lt; file.txt	1, Program_1's output becomes Program_2's input<br>2, Program_1's output and error logs are written to file.txt<br>3, Program_1 get its input from file.txt
Can filters be connected by pipes?	Yes, dumb question.
What is filters?	A program which accepts textual input and transforms it in some way.
which one is filter?<br>cat student_attendance.txt | grep -e August | sort	cat student_attendance.txt, grep -e Augusrt, sort

Give me two formats of structured data for representing rows and columns.	CSV (Comma Separated)<br>TSV (Tab Separated)
For Windows and Linux, what's the difference of new line cmd?	Windows uses /r/n (in order)<br>Mac and Linux now use /n
For CSV/TSV, what cases it works well and what cases it doesn't work well?	Work Well: Particular lists (lists of students, news articles...)<br><br>Work Bad: Flexible formats (one file that describes different contents)
For Human-readable and Machine-readable, answer the following:<br>structured/unstructured?<br>What each of it focus on?	Human-readable focus on usability and it's mostly unstructured.<br><br>Machine-readable focus on efficiency and it needs to be structured.
What is the definition of entity in computer science?	An entity is an object that has an identity, which is independent of the changes of its attributes.&nbsp;<br><br>It represents long-lived information relevant for the users and is usually stored in a database
State five types of Relationship Modelling, with its features.	1, Hierarchical - single parent<br>2, Network - multiple parent<br>3, Object-oriented - pointers<br>4, Object-relational - object as Tables<br>5, Entity-relational - conceptual entities as Tables

What's the relation between YAML and JSON?	YAML is a superset of JSON
What does YAML rely on for structure?	It relies on indentation and whitespace for structure
Is YAML key-value pair?	Yes -_-
Give an example of key-value pair	"name: Karso, where ""name"" = key and ""Karso"" = value"
What will happen if I use tabs to indent instead of spaces?	YAML use indentation to define the structure. However, it doesn't accept tabs for indentation, have to use spaces.
Is YAML markup language? Why?	YAML is a data serialization language.<br>Difference between markup language and data serialization language:<br>Markup languages focus on how data should be displayed or structured.<br>Data serialization languages focus on accurately and efficiently representing data structure in a standardized and exchangeable format.<br>As a result, considering the features of YAML, it's a data serialization language instead of markup language.
When/why would you use YAML?	Config files<br>Passing messages between applications<br>Saving (simple) application state
Why wouldn't you use YAML?	Not all parsers will give the same result
For YAML, what's the rule of Parent element?	Parent can't have a value and children.
Does JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) have classes?	No, it only has objects, lists and values, but no classes.

When do you need to use namespaces?	"When we want to bring in ""other"" XML elements and attributes that we can use into our own XML. <br>Namespaces can avoid conflicts and make it clear what refers to what."
For XML Schema Definition, every element can be defined as?	Simple, Complex
What's the difference between SimpleType and ComplexType in XML?	For SimpleType, it contains text only and the elements are of SimpleType by dfefault. Also, it cannot be empty.<br><br>For ComplexType, it can have attributes and can contain children (it can be empty, other elements, text, combination of text and other elements)&nbsp;
How to make the data persistent? Give three examples.	1, Writing into a local file on a local disk<br>2, Writing it across the network<br>3, Connecting to a database

In Java, how file is terminated?&nbsp;	"It's terminated with a special ""end-of-file"" marker byte"
What is the meaning of serialization?	To convert its state to a byte stream.
How to read a flattened object back from a file?	Deserialize the file
Is java.io.File an abstract representation?	Yes
Does creating a File object create or open a file in the underlying OS?	No
What does a File object do?	It provides a means of addressing one in Java, in a platform independent way.
What file objects are used as?	File objects are used as sources and targets of input and output streams to actually transfer data to and from disk.
What does the variant of File(String pathname) do?	It allows you to separately specify the path to the file and the file name itself.
How to create a File? Write the java code.	"import java.io.File;<br>import java.io.IOException;<br>public class File{<br>&nbsp; public static void main(String[ ] args){<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; String path = ""d:"" + File.separator + ""file.xxx"";<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; File file = new File(path);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; try{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;f.createNewFile();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; } catch(IOException e){<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;e.printStackTrace();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;}<br>&nbsp; }<br>}"

"Whether the data is being written to disk or sent across a network, at OS
level, the data will always end up as?&nbsp;"	Stream of bytes and then bits
Advangtage of treating a file as a stream of bytes?	Any client software accessing a file from a disk can use the same I/O interface as if it were receiving the same stream of bytes across the network.
Java use inputStream and outputStream as byte-based stream. How about character-based?	Reader &amp; Writer
Compare to byte-based streams, what's the advantage of using character-based?	More convenient to use for strings
Difference between inputStream and outputStream?	inputStream read, outputStream write&nbsp;
Code inputStream and outputStream	"input:<br><div><pre>public class InputTest {<br>  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {<br>    File file = new File(""test.txt"");<br>    InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(file);<br>    byte b[] = new byte[(int) file.length()];<br>    inputStream.read(b);<br>    inputStream.close();<br>    System.<span style=""font-style: italic;"">out</span>.println(new String(b));<br>  }<br>}</pre><pre>output:</pre><pre><div><pre>public class OutputTest {<br>  public OutputTest(String s) {<br>  }<br><br>  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{<br>    File file = new File(""test.txt"");<br>    OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(file);<br>    String str = ""Bye"";<br>    byte b[] = str.getBytes();<br>    outputStream.write(b);<br>    outputStream.close();<br>  }<br>}<br></pre></div></pre></div>"
Code character-based writer and reader stream	"Writer:<br><div><pre>public class characterWrite {<br>  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {<br>    File file = new File(""test.txt"");<br>    Writer writer = new FileWriter(file);<br>    String str = ""Character-based writer stream"";<br>    writer.write(str);<br>    writer.close();<br>  }<br>}</pre></div>Reader:<br><div><pre>public class characterRead {<br>  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {<br>    File file = new File(""test.txt"");<br>    Reader reader = new FileReader(file);<br>    int temp = 0;<br>    while((temp = reader.read()) != -1){<br>      System.<span style=""font-style: italic;"">out</span>.println((char)temp);<br>    }<br>    reader.close();<br>  }<br>}<br></pre></div>"
For character-based reader stream, what is the meaning of -1?	end of the stream has been reached
Does Java use UNICODE conventions to store characters?	Yes
"What is the meaning of a ""tagging"" interface? Give an example (java interface)"	"A ""tagging"" interface means it has no methods declared in it. One example is java.io.Serializable"
Using java.io.ObjectOutputStream, give an serialization example.	"File file = new File(""test.txt"");<br>OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);<br>ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(out);"
In Java, how to deserialize? What stream do you use?	ObjectInputStream
What does Object readObject() do?	An method to attempt to read an object from the InputStream.
Code a deserialization example.	"File file = new File(""test.txt"");<br>InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(file);<br>ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);<br>Object obj = ois.readObject();<br>ois.close();<br>System.out.println(obj);"
What's the problem with persistent objects?	The actual implementations of classes can vary over time.
What is a serial version UID?	As an object is serialized, a 64-bit secure hash of the full class descriptionis written as part of the object's state.
We can serialize an object if :	1, All the fields of its class are primitives and String<br>2, Other types are also acceptable as long as they are declared as Serializable
At the time of serialization, what can we do if we don't want to save value of a particular variable in a file?	"We can use "" transient "" keyword (e.g. private transient String name;)"
What is the meaning of field in Java?	Java fields are variables with Java classes&nbsp;
"The writeObject method of ObjectOutoutStream provides a default implementation
of object serialization.<br>What is the process?"	1, Write a hashcode of the current Class object for the object being serialized.<br><br>2, Serialize the fields of the object :<br>Ignore static fields&nbsp;<br>Ignore transient fields<br>Used a fixed encoding (cf. DataOutputStream) for primitive types and String values<br>Recursively call writeObject on reference types if they haven't already been serialized
"In order to
serialize an object of serializable class A, then either :"	Its superclass is also serializable or its superclass has a no argument constructor method
Is char a primitive datatype	Yes
What's the char value? (in bit)	16 bit
What's the common encoding of Unicode?	UTF-8
Is String jujst a sequence of Unicode values in Java?	No, Strings in Java are actually modelled as full-blown objects.
When you use a String in Java, what will JVM do?	JVM will allocagte heap-space for the object representing that string.
What's the difference between JVM and Java compiler?	When you run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles the program to bytecode. Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code.
What's the easiest way to create a String object?	Just write a string literal
"What's the difference between <br>&nbsp;String str = “Java”;
<br>and <br>char[] name = {‘J', ‘a’, ‘v', ‘a' };
<br>String str = new String(name);<br>Also, what's the advantage/disadvantage of using String str = “Java”"	"For String str =""Java"", it creates a string object using a string literal, and it's stored in string pool<br><br>For String str = new String(name), it creates a string object from arrays of char or bytes (in this case char), and each time this code is executed, a new String&nbsp;object is created in the heap, even if an identical string already exists.<br><br>Using string literal can save memory and faster<br>Using String str = new String() can guarantees the creation of a new <code>String</code> object every time, while string literals might reuse instances from the string pool."
"If we use ""=="" to compare different constructors for String class, we can only check if they are in the same heap-space. How could we compare the values of two strings?"	Using equals() method.
For int compareTo(String str), how it works?	It compare two strings in a lexicographic ordering to see whether one is less than the other
What will int compareTo(String str) returns if the strings have the same(or this string is less than str) content ?	Same content : return 0<br>Less than str : return -1<br>*It uses unicode representation
Are objects of type String immutable?	Yes, their contents cannot be changed
What's the difference between a machine and a virtual machine?	A virtual machine is similarly a machine with its own architecture and instruction set but the difference is that it is built in software rather than in hardware.
"Is the architecture of the JVM is
a high or low -level abstract
description?"	High-level abstract description
In Java, what's the difference between Heap Space and Stack?	Java Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack is only used for the method - or methods - currently running.
"For the architecture of the JVM, what subsystem is responsible
for locating your .class
files?"	The Class Loader subsystem
How Class Loader works in JVM ?	It verifies that .class files represent well-form (bytecode) classes, then it loads them into the Method Area of the shared memory, linking and initialising the class variables.
Wnat's the difference between Shared data areas and Non-shared data areas?	Shared data areas have one method area and one heap per JVM instance<br>For Non-shared data areas, each thread has its own Java Stack and Program Counter
What's the main role of the JVM ?	The main role of the JVM is to find the main method, load and execute our application.
Is there registers for JVM temporary data storage ?	No, JVM has a Stack Based architecture.
